# Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project is to created a portfolio to demonstrate my abilities as a multimedia developer. I have had other portfolio websites before,
and this is the first portfolio website that was built from scratch. It was important that it was done well. I learnt that it requires a lot of thought
to structure a website to be responsive.  

The following link is an image of the Website.
